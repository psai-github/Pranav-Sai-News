<h1>2021 NBA NEWS</h1>
<h2>Top 3 NBA teams in NBA history</h2>
<p><b>1.</b><br><u>Good and great teams play well under pressure.</u> The Lakers have done that all season. This is why the Lakers are the best team in nba history. This whole season LA Lakers have been averaging around 108.5 points a game; they have been on a scoring tear  this season and holding teams to around 88.7 points per game. Also the Lakers right now are going for the old good players and then trading them for young talent, and the best season of lakers was when they had Kareem, Magic and Elgin baylor.

<p><b>2.</b><br>The Boston Celtics are the 2nd greatest franchises in NBA history, largely because of the team's display of sheer dominance in the 1960s. The Celtics especially epitomized greatness in the 1964-65 NBA season. They played very well shooting and have young talent. Their gm was probably the most successful and smartest gm ever. The Celtics best season was when they had Larry Bird, Bill Russell and Kevin McHale all in their prime.
</p>
<p><b>3.</b><br>The Golden State Warriors are unstoppable on offense and are extremely intelligent + hard-working on defense. The opposition has to guard the 3-point line very tightly which allows GS to drive in to the paint with their athleticism and then kick it out/pass it in to an open man. Also the warriors have a huge amount of talent, and their team passes a lot.  
<p><br>Most likely players to win MVP in the 2021 season are Lebron, Joel Embid, Kevin Durant, and Steph curry.
