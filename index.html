<h1 style="color: blue;"> Coronavirus By Pranav 2021 feb 2</h1>
<h2 style="color: turquoise;">What is Coronavirus</h2>
<p style="color: bronze;">Corona virus means king virus,in latin.Firstly to be clear (covid-19) short for coronavirus is not realated to the famous brand corona beer.So what really is corona virus?Well covid-19 is a virus that spread all over the world,it has caused school's to close down and had a manager impact on componeys taking many peoples jobs.The virus is air born and can get in your body through your nose,mouth and eyes.This virus originated from china.And scientist's have discovered that humans got it from bats.The first human to get covid got it by eating a bat he bought.The virus spread's very easily and he had already spread it to so many people befor the first case of covid was diagnosed.So how did it spread all over the world?Well when people started travelingaround the world from china those people spread it to more people and it went on like that.To this date there millions of deaths around the world.

<h2 style="color: turquoise;">How to stop the spread of coronavirus</h2>
<p style="color: bronze;">There is one a few key thing's to keep in mind while trying not to get covid-19.The first is to stay 6 feet apart from each other and the second is to wear a mask!!! Corona virus can only go 6 feet airborn so if you are six feet away from everybody the virus wont spread airbornly.The mask is extra protection,so if you are not 6 feet apart it will be hard for the virus to enter your eyes,mouth and nose and will just stay on your mask.Also make sure not to touch your face because if you have touched something that has had covid on it can go to your mouth,nose and eyes if you touch them.</p>
<h2 style="color: turquoise;">Library? Sports complex!! Feb 2</h2>
<p style="color: red;">-(This was written from someone in the coronavirus pandemic.)If you are reading this after the pandemic is over.</p>
<p style="color: bronze;"spellcheck="true">
 There are two very important priorities we need now in our community, education and health.There are two things that will provide these need’s the best, a library and a sports complex. Though really there is only one that is beneficial  to our community at this time:  it is the sports complex. This is true with many factors, such as the communities health, cost and the need factor. 
Have you ever visited a public library in the last year? Well if you are 99.9 percent of the people who live in my community the answer is no. Literally, all the libraries in our community had to go online because no one was going there and they couldn't pay their mortgage and had to go online.  So there really isn't any point in spending the 250,000+ dollars just to build a library when there is a very high chance they are going to close in the first year. Rather than building the library and buying all those books,they could just start an ebook website which is worse than an actual library, (because we are already on computers a lot), but it still provides education.

With the Coronavirus shocking the nation by changing so many things, people are starting to pay less attention to the other big problems such as diabetes. According to the CDC since the pandemic started there has been a rate of 1 in 10 people who have gotten diagnosed with diabetes in the USA only. This is because people are going on lockdown’s in which they regularly don’t exercise at all. But people are forgetting that one of the ways to immune yourself from dying from the coronavirus is to stay healthy.Building more and more sports complexes will encourage people to come and exercise there because one, they have a safe place to do so and two, there is lots of supply and they will not be in contact with other people.

	Exercising does not only make you healthier and stronger but studies have shown that exercising also makes you mentaly stronger. When people start exercising more it will help people not only get through physically in the coronavirus times, but it will also help people clear their mind of all the stress that  people are going through from losing their jobs and losing their loved ones.
	Speaking of losing jobs,in coronavirus there was a 24.5 percent unemployment rate.Opening a sports complex would not only provide jobs to the people who work there but to coaches and the people who go to the sports complexes. When more and more people go and train at sports complexes more and more people will be highered to maintain it. Also as more and more people get better at sports more and more people will play on teams or even professionally giving jobs to the coaches who teach them. Finally if when people play professionally they will make millions and will help support their family or who knows maybe the community too!
	As you can see the coronavirus pandemic has changed how people see life forever. And all of us think we are going to wake up, and magicly all the stress will be  over. But life doesn't work that way, you need to work for good things to happen.So I encourage everybody reading this writing to take the first step to ending all of this nonsense,and build a sports complex. “Fight for what is right!!!”
